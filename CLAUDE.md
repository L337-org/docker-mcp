## Project

`docker-mcp` is a Python MCP server (requires Python >=3.14) managed with `uv` that exposes the Docker SDK for Python as MCP tools. The entry point is the `docker_mcp` package, run with `python -m docker_mcp` or via the installed console script. It is **published to PyPI as `docker-mcp-server`** (the `docker-mcp` name was already taken) and as a container image to GHCR (`ghcr.io/gavinlucas/docker-mcp-server`), mirrored to Docker Hub (`gavinlucas/docker-mcp-server`) when the opt-in `DOCKERHUB_*` release secrets are configured; the import package stays `docker_mcp` and the repo stays `…/docker-mcp`. Two console scripts are installed — `docker-mcp` and `docker-mcp-server` — both targeting `docker_mcp:main`. A third channel packages the server as a **Claude Desktop Extension (`.mcpb`)** attached to each GitHub Release — see "Desktop Extension (MCPB bundle)" below.

The `docker` dependency is pulled with its `[ssh]` extra (paramiko), so `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://…` works through a pure-Python transport — no system `ssh` binary, identical on the host and in the container images. docker-py auto-selects paramiko for `ssh://` when present, so there is no transport code to maintain (just the `ssh://` branch in `client._connection_help`). CLI-backed tools (Compose, Buildx, Context, Scout) shell out to `docker`, which would otherwise use the *system* `ssh` — instead, `_cli.py:run_docker` detects `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://…` and routes the subprocess through a per-call local TCP proxy (`docker_mcp/tools/_ssh_proxy.py`) that opens its own paramiko connection (mirroring docker-py's `SSHHTTPAdapter` defaults) and runs `docker system dial-stdio` over it, so the CLI authenticates identically to the docker-py-backed tools with no system `ssh` binary involved (the one exception being a `ProxyCommand` in `~/.ssh/config` for bastion/jump-host setups, which paramiko runs as an external command — commonly `ssh -W %h:%p ...` — same as it would for the docker-py-backed tools).

## Architecture

### Entry point
The `docker_mcp` package is the entry point. `docker_mcp/__init__.py` defines `main()` and side-effect-imports the `server` and `tools` submodules (which registers all `@tool()` decorators). `docker_mcp/__main__.py` calls `main()` so `python -m docker_mcp` works; the installed `docker-mcp` console script also targets `docker_mcp:main`.

### Server singleton (`docker_mcp/server.py`)
Instantiates `FastMCP`, exports the `mcp` object, and exports the `tool` and `prompt` registration helpers. **Tool modules import `tool`; prompt modules import `prompt`** — both gate on `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_DISABLE` (never import from `mcp` directly in those modules — that would create circular imports). `@mcp.resource()` modules still import `mcp` (plus `is_domain_disabled` / `register_resource_domains` for section gating).

```python
from docker_mcp.server import tool     # tool modules
from docker_mcp.server import prompt   # prompt modules (with domain=...)
from docker_mcp.server import mcp      # resource modules
```

`server.py` also owns the central **`TOOL_CATEGORIES`** map (every tool name → `READ_ONLY` / `MUTATING` / `DESTRUCTIVE`). The `@tool()` decorator uses it to (a) attach `ToolAnnotations` (`readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint`, plus `idempotentHint` for the prune family) and (b) skip registration entirely under the read-only env switches `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_READONLY` (only read-only tools) and `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_NO_DESTRUCTIVE` (everything except destructive). Every registered tool must have a `TOOL_CATEGORIES` entry — `tests/test_server.py` fails if the map and the registered set drift.

**Env-var naming.** All server tunables are namespaced `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_*` (matching the published package/image name `docker-mcp-server`). The pre-rename `DOCKER_MCP_*` spellings are still honored as deprecated aliases. Read env vars through `docker_mcp/_env.py` — `read_env("DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_NAME", "DOCKER_MCP_NAME")` or `env_flag(...)` — which prefers the canonical name, falls back to the alias, and prints a one-time deprecation notice to stderr (never stdout). `_env.py` lives at the package root (not under `tools/`) so `server.py` can import it without pulling in `docker_mcp.tools`, which would be a circular import at registration time; `_utils.py` re-exports `env_flag` / `read_env` for tool modules. A new tunable should add a canonical `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_*` name (no alias needed for net-new vars).

After registering each tool the decorator also calls `_slim_schema` on the tool's advertised `inputSchema` to delete three information-free patterns — together ~18% of the advertised schema tokens: (a) pydantic's `title` annotations (the title-cased field name on every property/`$def`, plus the top-level `<tool>Arguments` title); (b) the `{"type": "null"}` branch of a nullable `anyOf` (an `X | None` param — redundant with the field's optionality, dropped only when a sibling `default` is present so a required nullable can't be misrepresented); and (c) `additionalProperties: true` (the JSON Schema default; a schema-valued `additionalProperties` is kept). It's display-only: call-time validation runs off the tool's separate `fn_metadata`, so the slim never changes behavior. `tests/test_server.py` asserts none of the three survive on any registered tool.

The decorator also records each tool's **domain** — the leaf of its defining module (`docker_mcp.tools.containers` → `containers`) — so the orthogonal `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_DISABLE=<domains>` switch can drop a whole feature area (e.g. `swarm,plugins`) from the registered surface regardless of category. A tool registers only if its category survives the read-only switches *and* its domain is not disabled. `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_DISABLE` reaches beyond tools: the `prompt(domain=...)` helper skips a disabled domain's prompts, and `resources.py` hides a disabled domain's doc sections — so disabling e.g. `scout` drops its tools, its prompts, and its `docker-docs://scout` sections together. The full picture (every tool's domain/category, plus the `prompts` list and `disabled_doc_sections`) is exposed via `tool_catalog()` and the `docker-mcp://tool-catalog` resource, so the classification is auditable at runtime, not just in the source map.

**Server `instructions` router.** `server.py` also builds the FastMCP `instructions` string — the text a client pre-loads into context alongside the server name and tool names, *before* any per-tool schema. For a lazy-loading client (e.g. Claude Code, which fetches tool schemas on demand) that's the main always-in-context surface we control, so it's written as a **router**, not docs: a per-domain one-liner mapping user vocabulary onto the domain keyword a tool search will hit, plus a few tool-selection caveats. It deliberately does not enumerate tools (that's the `docker-mcp://tool-catalog` resource). It's built dynamically by `build_instructions()` from `_DOMAIN_BLURBS`, emitting a domain's line **only when that domain has a registered tool** — so `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_DISABLE` / `_READONLY` / `_NO_DESTRUCTIVE` are all honored through the one registration flag, and the router never advertises a domain whose tools didn't register. `finalize_instructions()` (called from `docker_mcp/__init__.py` *after* every tool module imports) writes the result through to `mcp._mcp_server.instructions` — FastMCP's `instructions` is a read-only property whose value is read at `run()` time, so a late write propagates to the MCP initialize handshake; the `_mcp_server` reach-in is guarded like `_slim_schema`. **A new tool *domain* needs a `_DOMAIN_BLURBS` entry** or the router silently omits it (`tests/test_server.py` checks the router tracks the registered domain set).

### Multi-daemon host registry (`docker_mcp/_hosts.py`)

`DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_HOSTS` lets one server manage several daemons in a session (e.g. local dev + remote prod). It's the single source of truth for which daemon(s) to talk to: **when it's set, `DOCKER_HOST` is ignored** (a one-time stderr notice fires when both are set); when unset, the server falls back to today's single-daemon behavior (`DOCKER_HOST`, else auto-discovery). The mcpb bundle exposes only this field.

`_hosts.py` lives at the package root (like `_env.py`, so `server.py` can import it without pulling in `docker_mcp.tools`). It parses the var into a pinned `{label: Host}` registry and owns all host resolution — no docker-py/CLI calls, just env + Docker config-file reads:

- **Grammar.** No `=` in the value → bare single-host shorthand (`ssh://ops@prod(ro)`, `auto`, `local`, or empty → `auto`). With `=` → comma-separated `label=endpoint` list. `endpoint` is the keyword `auto`/`local` or a `unix://`/`tcp://`/`ssh://`/`npipe://` URL, with combinable trailing markers `(ro)` (read-only) and `(tls=<dir>)` (a tcp+TLS cert dir holding Docker's `ca.pem`/`cert.pem`/`key.pem`). **Fail-fast** (`HostConfigError` → stderr + exit non-zero) on duplicate/empty/invalid labels, a missing `=`, an unknown marker, `(tls=)` on a non-tcp endpoint, missing/unreadable cert files, or an unrecognized scheme.
- **`auto`/`local`/`default` are OUR concepts, resolved to concrete URLs by us and pinned at `load()` (startup)** — so the docker-py SDK and the docker-CLI shell-out provably target the *same* daemon for a given label (auditable), and a mid-session `docker context use` can't silently move a label (restart to re-resolve). `auto` = the active CLI context's endpoint (`DOCKER_CONTEXT` / config.json `currentContext` → its `meta.json` Host) else the `local` socket probe; `local` = the platform-local socket (the `_probe_default_socket` candidate list); `default` = the omitted-`host` fallback = the first registry entry, and is **not** a selectable label. These resolution helpers were relocated *from* `client.py` into `_hosts.py`.
- **`load()` runs in `docker_mcp/__init__.py` before the tools import** (the `@tool()` decorator and resources read `is_multi()`/`labels()` at registration time) and scrubs whole-value `${...}` placeholders first (`_env.scrub_unresolved_env`, so an mcpb blank field resolves to the default host instead of fail-fasting).

**Per-call host selection (no modal active-host state).** Every daemon-targeting tool declares `host: str | None = None` and threads it to `_get_client(host)` / `run_docker(..., host=host)`; the `@tool()` decorator does the rest, gated on `_hosts.is_multi()`:
- **Schema surgery** (`_apply_host_schema`, display-only like `_slim_schema` — call-time validation runs off `fn_metadata`): single-host → strip the `host` property entirely (footprint-neutral, schema byte-identical to today); multi-host → constrain `host` to an `enum` of the labels and mark it required for writes.
- **Call-time guard** (`_enforce_host_guard`, wrapped onto the tool via `_wrap_with_host_guard`, which preserves the signature and sync/async-ness): writes require an explicit `host`, unknown labels are rejected, and writes to an `(ro)` host are refused. Read-only tools and the `_CONNECTION_CONTROL` set (`close`/`reconnect`/`login`/`logout`) may omit `host`. **Excluded** (no `host` param at all): `registry`/`hub_*` (HTTPS, no daemon) and `context` (manages the host's CLI contexts).

**Client side** (`client.py`): a lazy pool `_clients` keyed by label; `_get_client(host)` builds per host with tiered TLS (`(tls=)` cert dir → global `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`/`DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` → plaintext); the legacy single host (unset var) still goes through `_build_default_client`/`from_env` unchanged, and an explicit host that resolves to the platform default (url `None`) is built without a `base_url` so it never re-reads the ignored ambient `DOCKER_HOST`. `close(host=None)` closes all/one; **`reconnect(host=None)` is rebuild-only** — it cannot retarget to an arbitrary URL (to change a daemon, edit the registry and restart), which closes a trust-expansion hole. `_cli.py:_apply_host_env` injects the resolved `DOCKER_HOST` + per-host TLS into the child env for an explicit host (the ssh:// proxy keys off it). `startup_preflight` pings the *default* host but detects self-id against the *self host* (first local-transport entry, which may differ from a remote default), and `guard_not_self(container, host=)` only fires on the self host.

**Surfaces.** `list_hosts` (READ_ONLY) tool + the `docker-mcp://hosts` resource expose the resolved registry (the default is observable but not selectable). The router (`build_instructions`) adds a multi-host caveat, the container observability resources switch to empty-authority / host-qualified URIs (see MCP resources below), and a `prompt(multi_host=True)` gate plus the `survey_hosts` prompt register only when 2+ hosts are configured. **When changing the host grammar, the env-var precedence, the per-tool/resource/prompt host surface, or the resolution semantics, update this section.**

### Tools package (`docker_mcp/tools/`)
Each file maps to one Docker SDK domain (or, for CLI-only and registry-only features, one Docker feature area) and contains `@tool()` decorated functions. `docker_mcp/tools/__init__.py` imports all public modules with `*` so `docker_mcp/__init__.py` only needs `from docker_mcp import tools`. Underscore-prefixed modules (`_cli.py`, `_utils.py`) are private helpers and stay out of the star-import.

### Tests (`tests/`)
Each `docker_mcp/tools/<module>.py` has a corresponding `tests/test_<module>.py`. Tests use pytest. The `tests/__init__.py` is intentionally empty.

`tests/integration/` holds tests that hit a real Docker daemon. `tests/integration/conftest.py` auto-marks every test in the directory with `@pytest.mark.integration` (excluded by default via `addopts = "-m 'not integration'"` in `pyproject.toml`) and provides an autouse `skip_if_no_daemon` fixture so the suite skips cleanly when no daemon is reachable. Run with `uv run pytest -m integration`.

### Container image (`Dockerfile`)

An additional distribution channel alongside uvx-from-git (which is unchanged). One multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds variants via build args (`INSTALL_CLI`, `INSTALL_SCOUT`, `DISABLE_DOMAINS`): `full` (docker CLI + compose + buildx + scout) and `no-scout` (sets `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_DISABLE=scout` so the absent-plugin scout tools don't register) are **published to GHCR (and mirrored to Docker Hub when the Hub secrets are set) on each GitHub Release** — the same tags on each registry (`full` → `:latest`/`:<version>`, `no-scout` → `:no-scout`/`:<version>-no-scout`); `lite` (`INSTALL_CLI=0`, docker-py SDK only — CLI domains degrade via `has_plugin()`) is buildable but not published. `.github/workflows/images.yaml` builds+measures on PRs/pushes to main; `.github/workflows/publish-images.yaml` pushes multi-arch images on a GitHub Release (kept a separate workflow so it never shows as a skipped check on PRs) — always to GHCR, and mirrored to Docker Hub (`gavinlucas/docker-mcp-server`, plus a `DOCKERHUB.md`→Hub-description sync — a slim container-focused readme, since the full `README.md` exceeds Hub's 25 KB cap) when the opt-in `DOCKERHUB_USER`/`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets are set (the Hub token needs `read/write/delete` scope or the description PATCH 403s); with them unset, only GHCR is pushed so a release never fails for lack of Hub credentials. Two container-aware guards live behind `_utils.in_container()` (true when `/.dockerenv` exists or `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_IN_CONTAINER=1`, set in the image) and are **inert on the host install**:

- **Filesystem guard** (`_utils.py`): `assert_host_writable` (hooked into `stream_to_file`) refuses a `*_to_file` write to a path that isn't a host bind mount (silent loss on `--rm`); `host_read_path` enriches the "missing file" case on reads. `_host_backed` parses `/proc/self/mountinfo`.
- **Self-termination guard** (`client.py`): `startup_preflight()` (called from `main()`) pings the default daemon, prints OS-aware socket hints to **stderr** (never stdout — that's the stdio channel) on failure, and pins the server's own container id (detected against the *self host* — the first local-transport entry, which can differ from a remote default); `guard_not_self(container, host=)` then makes the destructive container-lifecycle tools refuse to act on self, **only when the call targets the self host** (override: `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_ALLOW_SELF_TERMINATE=1`).

### Desktop Extension (MCPB bundle)

A third distribution channel (alongside uvx/PyPI and the container images) for one-click install in Claude Desktop. The repo root carries the bundle sources: `manifest.json` (the MCPB manifest, `manifest_version` 0.4, `server.type: "uv"`), `mcpb_run.py` (the bundle entry point — `from docker_mcp import main; main()`, kept at the root so `import docker_mcp` resolves however the host's managed `uv` lays out `sys.path`), `.mcpbignore` (trims the packed bundle to source + `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` + `README.md`/`LICENSE` + `manifest.json`/`mcpb_run.py` + `assets/`), and `assets/icon.png` (512×512). Because it's a `uv`-type bundle, the host resolves dependencies from `pyproject.toml` at install time — there's no vendored venv, so the bundle stays ~250 KB and cross-platform. `manifest.json`'s `user_config` block renders the install-dialog fields and maps them to env: `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_HOSTS` (the single host field — `DOCKER_HOST` is deliberately **not** exposed; the bare-value shorthand keeps the simple one-daemon case a one-liner) plus the `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_READONLY` / `_NO_DESTRUCTIVE` / `_DISABLE` switches (the container-only `_ALLOW_SELF_TERMINATE` is deliberately **not** exposed — the bundle never runs containerized). The `manifest.json` `version` is kept in step with `pyproject.toml`, but `.github/workflows/publish-mcpb.yaml` rewrites it from the release tag at pack time so it can't drift; that workflow packs the `.mcpb` with `npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb` and attaches it (plus a `.sha256`) to each GitHub Release. `PRIVACY.md` (a no-telemetry/no-backend statement) is referenced by the manifest's `privacy_policies` and summarized in the README. **When the manifest's tool/env surface or the bundled file set changes, update this section.**

### MCP Registry (`server.json`)

A discovery listing in the official MCP Registry (`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`), which stores only **metadata** pointing at the artifacts the other channels already publish — so it's not a fourth artifact, just an index entry covering all of them. `server.json` (repo root, server name `io.github.GavinLucas/docker-mcp-server`) declares three package types in one entry: `pypi` (`docker-mcp-server`), `oci` (the GHCR image), and `mcpb` (the release `.mcpb`). `.github/workflows/publish-registry.yaml` runs on each GitHub Release: it stamps the tag version and the published `.mcpb`'s `fileSha256` into `server.json`, authenticates via **GitHub OIDC** (`id-token: write`, no stored secret), and runs `mcp-publisher publish`. The registry verifies we own each listed package by matching a marker against `server.json`'s `name`, so three markers must stay equal to it: the `<!-- mcp-name: … -->` comment in `README.md` (PyPI long-description), the `io.modelcontextprotocol.server.name` image label in `publish-images.yaml` (OCI), and the `.mcpb` URL (must contain "mcp") + its hash (MCPB). All three must be live in the *same* release for a publish to succeed; the workflow runs late and retries to absorb the race with the sibling PyPI/image/mcpb workflows (re-runnable via `workflow_dispatch`). **If `server.json`'s name/markers or the package set change, update this section.**

## Conventions

- New Docker functionality goes in the matching `docker_mcp/tools/<domain>.py` file, not in a new file.
- Every new `docker_mcp/tools/` file must be imported in `docker_mcp/tools/__init__.py` (private `_*.py` helpers excluded).
- Every new `docker_mcp/tools/<module>.py` must have a matching `tests/test_<module>.py`.
- Tool functions are decorated with `@tool()` (imported from `docker_mcp.server`) and must have a `TOOL_CATEGORIES` entry in `docker_mcp/server.py`.
- Line length limit: 120 characters (enforced by ruff and flake8).

## Provenance labels

Resources this server **creates** are stamped with `docker-mcp-server.*` provenance labels (`.managed=true`, `.version`, `.tool`, `.created`) via `docker_mcp/tools/_labels.py`, so the agent/operator can later enumerate that footprint — the `managed_only=True` arg on `list_containers` / `list_networks` / `list_volumes` / `list_services`, or `--filter label=docker-mcp-server.managed=true`. The `prune_managed` prompt tears down only the managed footprint. Stamping is **on by default** and additive (a caller-supplied label always wins on a key collision); `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_NO_LABELS=1` turns it off. The prefix is the bare project name (deliberately not reverse-DNS) and is a single constant in `_labels.py`.

When adding a new create tool that accepts a `labels` dict, route it through `_labels.py:with_provenance(labels, "<tool_name>")` (it accepts the dict/list/None shapes the SDK accepts and returns `None` — feed it through `drop_none` — when stamping is off and the caller passed nothing). The six stamped creators today are `run_container`, `create_container`, `create_network`, `create_volume`, `create_service` (service-level `labels` only, not `container_labels`), `create_config`, `create_secret`. **Image builds are intentionally NOT stamped** — a build label changes the resulting image digest. Compose/stack containers (created via CLI shell-out) are also unstamped. New `managed_only`-style label filters go through `_labels.py:managed_filter`.

## CLI shell-out policy

Any tool that wraps a `docker` CLI feature (Compose, Context, Buildx, Scout, etc.) MUST go through `docker_mcp/tools/_cli.py:run_docker` — never call `subprocess.run` directly from a tool module. The helper centralizes:

- Binary resolution via `shutil.which` (handles `docker` vs `docker.exe` on Windows).
- `shell=False` always; argv as a list so PowerShell/cmd/zsh quoting cannot bite us.
- UTF-8 decoding with `errors="replace"` (Windows defaults to cp1252 otherwise).
- Output byte cap with a `truncated` flag in the result.
- `creationflags=CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows so child processes don't flash a console.
- Environment scrubbed to an allow-list (DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_CONTEXT, PATH, etc., plus Windows-specific keys for credential helpers).
- Plugin availability probing via `has_plugin(name)` / `require_plugin(name)`.

Multi-platform notes for new shell-out tools:

- **Never** pass `shell=True`, never construct paths by string concatenation, never expand `~` or globs yourself (use `Path.expanduser()` / `Path.glob()`).
- Always pass an explicit `timeout=` to `run_docker`; pick a generous ceiling for long-running ops (build/pull at 1800s) and a short one for queries.
- Don't hardcode binary paths — Docker Desktop on Mac, Windows, and Linux all install `docker` differently; `shutil.which` is the only safe lookup.

### CLI error convention (intentional, do not "unify")

CLI-backed tools follow one of two error styles depending on what they return:

- **Action tools** (`compose_up`, `buildx_build`, `context_use`, …) return the raw `{"returncode", "stdout", "stderr", "truncated"}` dict from `CliResult.to_dict()` and never raise on a non-zero exit — stderr is informative, and the agent decides what to do with a failure.
- **Parsed-query tools** (`context_ls`, `buildx_ls`, `buildx_du`, `compose_ls`) return a parsed list/dict and therefore *cannot* return a useful partial result on failure — they raise `RuntimeError` via `_cli.py:raise_on_cli_failure`. (`compose_ps` is the hybrid: it returns `{"services": [...], "raw": <CliResult dict>}` so the caller gets both.)

New CLI tools should pick the style matching their return shape rather than mixing them.

## Checklist when adding a new tool module

When you add a new `docker_mcp/tools/<domain>.py` (especially for CLI features outside docker-py), update **all** of these — easy to miss:

1. `docker_mcp/tools/__init__.py` — star-import.
2. `docker_mcp/server.py` — add a `TOOL_CATEGORIES` entry for every new tool (`READ_ONLY` / `MUTATING` / `DESTRUCTIVE`); `tests/test_server.py` fails otherwise. A new module is a new **domain**, so also add a `_DOMAIN_BLURBS` entry (one-line router blurb) or the `instructions` router will silently omit it.
3. `tests/test_<domain>.py` — unit tests using mocks.
4. `tests/integration/test_<domain>.py` — at least one happy-path test against a real daemon (override `skip_if_no_daemon` if the module doesn't need one).
5. `docker_mcp/tools/prompts.py` — at least one `@mcp.prompt()` template using the new tools.
6. `docker_mcp/tools/resources.py` — add a section under `SDK_SECTIONS` or `EXTERNAL_SECTIONS` pointing at the authoritative docs.
7. `README.md` — append to "What the agent can do" and "Security considerations" (the latter only if a new class of risk is introduced).
8. `SECURITY.md` — only if a new class of risk is introduced beyond what's already documented.
9. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — **mirror the architecture/convention change here too** (see the MIRROR RULE at the top of this file); it drives Copilot's review of every PR.

### Tool function format

All `@tool()` functions must follow this exact docstring format:

```python
from docker_mcp.server import tool


@tool()
def mcp_example(name: str):
    """
    Say hello to someone by name.

    args: name - The name to say hello to
    returns: str - The greeting
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

- One-line summary sentence, then a blank line
- `args:` section lists each parameter as `name - description`. Do **not** repeat the parameter's
  type — the type annotation already lands in the tool's `inputSchema`, which the client sees
  alongside the description, so a `name: type - ...` form just duplicates it as prose tokens. (The
  `returns:` line keeps its type, since the return shape is not in the input schema.)
- `returns:` line documents the return type and what it contains
- Keep descriptions terse: state every functional fact (defaults, accepted formats/values, return
  keys, important caveats) but cut redundancy and verbose phrasing. The docstring is the entire
  tool `description` the client pays tokens for on every session.

### MCP resources

`docker_mcp/tools/resources.py` exposes `@mcp.resource(uri, mime_type=...)` endpoints (not tools) for read-only data: the Docker SDK for Python documentation under the `docker-docs://` URI scheme, plus `docker-mcp://tool-catalog` (the live tool/domain/category snapshot from `server.tool_catalog()`), `docker-mcp://hosts` (the resolved host registry, mirroring `list_hosts`), and the container-observability resources `docker://containers` (index of all containers + per-container URIs), `docker-logs://{id_or_name}` (bounded log tail), and `docker-stats://{id_or_name}` (computed usage summary). **In multi-host mode these container resources are host-aware:** the default-host forms become empty-authority (`docker:///containers`, `docker-logs:///{id}`, `docker-stats:///{id}`) and host-qualified variants (`docker://{host}/containers`, `docker-logs://{host}/{id}`, …) are registered alongside, disambiguated by path-segment count; single-host keeps the bare forms unchanged. Registration is gated on `_hosts.is_multi()`, and the index emits child `logs`/`stats` URIs matching its own scheme. The container resources reuse the private `_read_log_tail` / `_read_stats_summary` helpers in `containers.py` (which take a `host=`) and refuse at read time when the `containers` domain is disabled (mirroring `get_docs_section`). Each doc section maps to a domain via `_SECTION_DOMAINS` (registered with the server through `register_resource_domains`), so `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_DISABLE` hides a disabled domain's sections from `docker-docs://contents` and makes `get_docs_section` refuse them. Resources follow the same docstring format as tools and are also star-imported via `docker_mcp/tools/__init__.py`.

### MCP prompts

`docker_mcp/tools/prompts.py` exposes `@prompt(description=..., domain=...)` templates (the `prompt` helper imported from `docker_mcp.server`, **not** `@mcp.prompt` directly) that return rendered prompt strings to guide multi-step docker workflows (deploy, migrate, troubleshoot, prune, audit/security, networking, volume backup/restore, doc lookup). Each prompt declares its primary `domain` so `DOCKER_MCP_SERVER_DISABLE` skips it when that domain is off; use `domain=None` for general / cross-domain prompts (doc lookup, prune, disk usage) that should always register. Prompts follow the same docstring format as tools and are star-imported via `docker_mcp/tools/__init__.py`.

## Docker SDK Policy

**Before writing or modifying any code that calls the Docker SDK (`docker` package), you MUST run `/docker-sdk` (or `/docker-sdk <topic>`) to:**
1. Verify exact method signatures from the live Docker SDK for Python documentation
2. Confirm parameter names and return types before writing code
3. Never use a `docker` module method that has not been confirmed in the docs

Do not assume any method exists because it sounds plausible. If you cannot confirm it from the documentation, say so and do not use it.

When the high-level SDK has no method for an operation (e.g. swarm node removal, service rollback), drop to the low-level **`APIClient` via `_get_client().api`** — its methods (`remove_node`, `update_service`, `inspect_service`, …) are documented at https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html and must be verified the same way. Prefer the high-level object API when it exists; reach for `client.api` only for the gaps.
